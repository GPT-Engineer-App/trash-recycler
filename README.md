# trash-recycler

i want to create a self contained machine learning, object detection &/or tracking with incrementally increasing counters for up to 5 simulatenous different classes of drink container that are sorted out of the gaarbage on the back of my ute at night at a 24 hour truck stop. i want half the screen mimimum, but prefer 3/4 with full screenm optionality. the detection, bounding box area mand tracking areas have to be superimposed, tht is the bounding box must be overlayed on the live stream feed. also the option to set ROI with way points that interconnect upon placing he next until the shape is finished at thhe firtst way point. i want seperate landing page, intro/instructions page with initial setup parameter selection. e.g. the option to select  Object detection or ROI  monitoring and counting of object passing through the  opening  i.e selecting the opening of the bag that I sought the cans and bottles into. then the live view page/camera feed page with a heads up display annotation with the fps, any pertinent data and a running tally. the next page has all the persistant tallies for week, month YTD indivually and collectiovely, download/share resullts, machine learmimg & detection learning/fine tuning settings, video enahncements ie brightness, quality etc, fps, wtc etc.
